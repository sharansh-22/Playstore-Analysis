********************************Playstore App Market Analysis********************************

This project analyzes Google Playstore application data to identify patterns related to installs, ratings, app size, pricing, and categories.
The goal is to understand what contributes to an application's success and what factors correlate with user preference and engagement.

******Objective******

 To extract practical insights from Playstore data that can assist in:

  1. deciding what category to build in.

  2. pricing strategies for apps,

  3. understanding what influences rating and install count.

******Project Structure******

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing -> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -> Insight Generation -> Dashboard (HTML / PowerBI) for visual interpretation

******Tools and Libraries******

 1. Python

 2. Pandas, NumPy ( Data Manipulation )

 3. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly ( Data Visualization )

 4. HTML/PowerBI for dashboard view ( Story Telling )

******Key Observations******

 1. Games, Tools, and Productivity are the most saturated and high-install categories.

 2. Smaller applications (size-optimized) generally have better ratings.

 3. Free applications attract higher user volume.

 4. Paid applications often receive better quality ratings, possibly due to user expectation and niche targeting.

 5. Category, size, and price together form the strongest drivers of install count and rating.

******Current Deliverables******

 1. Cleaned dataset

 2. Structured EDA

 3. Insight summary

 4. HTML dashboard for non-technical interpretation

******Conclusion******

This project demonstrates the ability to handle raw data, process it into structured form, identify patterns through exploratory analysis, and communicate findings with clarity.

***Planned Improvements***(WIP)

Build a prediction model for rating or success classification

Feature importance and explainability analysis

Add model deployment interface for real-time predictions

Future integration of machine learning will convert this into a complete end-to-end data product.
